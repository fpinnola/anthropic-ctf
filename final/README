So you did some steganography cracking, huh? Nice job.

The next and final part of this puzzle relies on some understanding of simple
multilayer perceptron behaviors. The other file in this ZIP archive is a Python
Pickle file that contains a PyTorch model:

1. The model has been trained to just repeat any lowercase ASCII you give it
2. Except it has also been trained to output a special "flag" given the right
   password

The input to the model is one-hot encoded and shaped (B, N, V) where:

- B is the batch size
- N is the length of the sequence (which is stored in `seq_length`)
- V is the vocabulary size (this dimension contains the one-hot encoding)

Your goal is to reverse engineer, crack, or otherwise manipulate the model to
extract the password.

Once you complete the puzzle, either find Ziyad at the BSidesSF Anthropic
