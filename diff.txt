File 2: Mr. Benson?

Line 802:

Line 803:
File 1: How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?

File 2: So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.

Line 859:

File 2: That's where I usually sit. Right... there.

Line 860:

File 2: You think I don't see what you're doing?

Line 862:

Line 864:
File 1: Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
File 2: Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

File 2: That's just what I was thinking about doing.

Line 866:
File 1: I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.

File 2: Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

Line 874:
File 1: You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.

Line 876:

Line 901:
File 1: My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!

Line 906:
File 1: I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.
File 2: We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

Line 907:
File 1: Oh, well.
File 2: Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...

File 2: Yeah.

Line 909:
File 1: I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
File 2: Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.

Line 910:
File 1: We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
File 2: Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.

Line 911:
File 1: Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...

File 2: Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?

Line 921:
File 1: Good friends?
File 2: I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?

Line 922:
File 1: Yes.
File 2: Yeah, but...

Line 923:
File 1: How good? Do you live together?

Line 955:
File 1: I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!
File 2: What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.

Line 956:

Line 957:
File 1: You think it was all a trap?
File 2: I don't know.

File 2: Where is the rest of your team?

Line 976:
File 1: And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
File 2: Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.

Line 977:
File 1: Mr. Flayman.
File 2: I actually heard a funny story about...

Line 978:
File 1: Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
File 2: Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?

File 2: What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

Line 991:
File 1: You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.
File 2: Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?

Line 992:
File 1: What is that?
File 2: Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?

Line 993:
File 1: It's a bee smoker!

Line 1011:
File 1: All right. One at a time.
File 2: What do you mean?

Line 1012:
File 1: Barry, who are you wearing?
File 2: We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.

Line 1013:
File 1: My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.
File 2: Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?

Line 1014:
File 1: What if Montgomery's right?
File 2: First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.

Line 1015:
File 1: What do you mean?
File 2: Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.

Line 1016:
File 1: We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.
File 2: We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.

File 1: Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
File 2: We're all aware of what they do in the woods.

File 2: And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...

File 2: But it's just a prance-about stage name!

Line 1022:

Line 1046:

File 2: Now I can't.

Line 1051:
File 1: Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
File 2: I don't understand why they're not happy.

Line 1052:
File 1: It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.
File 2: I thought their lives would be better!

Line 1053:
File 1: This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...
File 2: They're doing nothing. It's amazing.

Line 1054:
File 1: Now I can't.
File 2: Honey really changes people.

Line 1055:
File 1: I don't understand why they're not happy.
File 2: You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?

Line 1056:
File 1: I thought their lives would be better!
File 2: What did you want to show me?

Line 1057:
File 1: They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
File 2: This.

Line 1058:
File 1: Honey really changes people.
File 2: What happened here?

Line 1059:
File 1: You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
File 2: That is not the half of it.

Line 1060:
File 1: What did you want to show me?
File 2: Oh, no. Oh, my.

Line 1061:
File 1: This.
File 2: They're all wilting.

Line 1062:
File 1: What happened here?
File 2: Doesn't look very good, does it?

Line 1063:
File 1: That is not the half of it.
File 2: No.

Line 1064:
File 1: Oh, no. Oh, my.
File 2: And whose fault do you think that is?

Line 1065:
File 1: They're all wilting.
File 2: You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

Line 1066:
File 1: Doesn't look very good, does it?
File 2: Bees?

Line 1067:
File 1: No.
File 2: Specifically, me.

Line 1068:
File 1: And whose fault do you think that is?
File 2: I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.

Line 1069:
File 1: You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
File 2: It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

Line 1070:
File 1: Bees?
File 2: That's our whole SAT test right there.

Line 1071:
File 1: Specifically, me.
File 2: Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.

Line 1072:
File 1: I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.
File 2: And then, of course...

Line 1073:
File 1: It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
File 2: The human species?

Line 1074:
File 1: That's our whole SAT test right there.
File 2: So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?

Line 1075:
File 1: Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.
File 2: I know this is also partly my fault.

Line 1076:
File 1: And then, of course...
File 2: How about a suicide pact?

Line 1077:
File 1: The human species?
File 2: How do we do it?

Line 1078:
File 1: So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?
File 2: I'll sting you, you step on me.

Line 1079:
File 1: I know this is also partly my fault.
File 2: That just kills you twice.

Line 1080:
File 1: How about a suicide pact?
File 2: Right, right.

Line 1081:
File 1: How do we do it?
File 2: Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.

Line 1082:
File 1: I'll sting you, you step on me.
File 2: I had to open my mouth and talk.

Line 1083:
File 1: That just kills you twice.
File 2: Vanessa?

Line 1084:
File 1: Right, right.
File 2: Vanessa? Why are you leaving?

Line 1085:
File 1: Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.
File 2: Where are you going?

Line 1086:
File 1: I had to open my mouth and talk.
File 2: To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.

Line 1087:
File 1: Vanessa?
File 2: They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.

Line 1088:
File 1: Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
File 2: It's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it.

Line 1089:
File 1: Where are you going?
File 2: Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

Line 1090:
File 1: To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
File 2: I never meant it to turn out like this.

Line 1091:
File 1: They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
File 2: I know. Me neither.

Line 1092:
File 1: It's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it.
File 2: Tournament of Roses.

Line 1093:
File 1: Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
File 2: Roses can't do sports.

Line 1094:
File 1: I never meant it to turn out like this.
File 2: Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

Line 1095:
File 1: I know. Me neither.
File 2: Roses!

Line 1096:
File 1: Tournament of Roses.
File 2: Vanessa!

Line 1097:
File 1: Roses can't do sports.
File 2: Roses?!

Line 1098:
File 1: Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
File 2: Barry?

Line 1099:
File 1: Roses!
File 2: Roses are flowers!

Line 1100:
File 1: Vanessa!
File 2: Yes, they are.

Line 1101:
File 1: Roses?!
File 2: Flowers, bees, pollen!

Line 1102:
File 1: Barry?
File 2: I know.

Line 1103:
File 1: Roses are flowers!
File 2: That's why this is the last parade.

Line 1104:
File 1: Yes, they are.
File 2: Maybe not.

Line 1105:
File 1: Flowers, bees, pollen!
File 2: Could you ask him to slow down?

Line 1106:
File 1: I know.
File 2: Could you slow down?

Line 1107:
File 1: That's why this is the last parade.
File 2: Barry!

Line 1108:
File 1: Maybe not.
File 2: OK, I made a huge mistake.

Line 1109:
File 1: Could you ask him to slow down?
File 2: This is a total disaster, all my fault.

Line 1110:
File 1: Could you slow down?
File 2: Yes, it kind of is.

Line 1111:
File 1: Barry!
File 2: I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.

Line 1112:
File 1: OK, I made a huge mistake.
File 2: Actually, it's completely closed down.

Line 1113:
File 1: This is a total disaster, all my fault.
File 2: I thought maybe you were remodeling.

Line 1114:
File 1: Yes, it kind of is.
File 2: But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.

Line 1115:
File 1: I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.
File 2: I don't want to hear it!

Line 1116:
File 1: Actually, it's completely closed down.
File 2: All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

Line 1117:
File 1: I thought maybe you were remodeling.
File 2: I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.

Line 1118:
File 1: But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.
File 2: All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.

Line 1119:
File 1: I don't want to hear it!
File 2: Bees.

Line 1120:
File 1: All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.
File 2: Park.

Line 1121:
File 1: I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.
File 2: Pollen!

Line 1122:
File 1: All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
File 2: Flowers.

Line 1123:
File 1: Bees.
File 2: Repollination!

Line 1124:
File 1: Park.
File 2: Across the nation!

Line 1125:
File 1: Pollen!
File 2: Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.

Line 1126:
File 1: Flowers.
File 2: They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

Line 1127:
File 1: Repollination!
File 2: Security will be tight.

Line 1128:
File 1: Across the nation!
File 2: I have an idea.

Line 1129:
File 1: Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.
File 2: Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

Line 1130:
File 1: They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
File 2: Official floral business. It's real.

Line 1131:
File 1: Security will be tight.
File 2: Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

Line 1132:
File 1: I have an idea.
File 2: Thank you. It was a gift.

Line 1133:
File 1: Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
File 2: Once inside, we just pick the right float.

Line 1134:
File 1: Official floral business. It's real.
File 2: How about The Princess and the Pea?

Line 1135:
File 1: Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
File 2: I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!

Line 1136:
File 1: Thank you. It was a gift.
File 2: Yes, I got it.

Line 1137:
File 1: Once inside, we just pick the right float.
File 2: Where should I sit?

Line 1138:
File 1: How about The Princess and the Pea?
File 2: What are you?

Line 1139:
File 1: I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!
File 2: I believe I'm the pea.

Line 1140:
File 1: Yes, I got it.
File 2: The pea?

Line 1141:
File 1: Where should I sit?
File 2: It goes under the mattresses.

Line 1142:
File 1: What are you?
File 2: Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.

Line 1143:
File 1: I believe I'm the pea.
File 2: I'm getting the marshal.

Line 1144:
File 1: The pea?
File 2: You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!

Line 1145:
File 1: It goes under the mattresses.
File 2: Let's see what this baby'll do.

Line 1146:
File 1: Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
File 2: Hey, what are you doing?!

Line 1147:
File 1: I'm getting the marshal.
File 2: Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.

Line 1148:
File 1: You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
File 2: Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.

Line 1149:
File 1: Let's see what this baby'll do.
File 2: Stop! Security.

Line 1150:
File 1: Hey, what are you doing?!
File 2: You and your insect pack your float?

Line 1151:
File 1: Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.
File 2: Yes.

Line 1152:
File 1: Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.
File 2: Has it been in your possession the entire time?

Line 1153:
File 1: Stop! Security.
File 2: Would you remove your shoes?

Line 1154:
File 1: You and your insect pack your float?
File 2: Remove your stinger.

Line 1155:
File 1: Yes.
File 2: It's part of me.

Line 1156:
File 1: Has it been in your possession the entire time?
File 2: I know. Just having some fun.

Line 1157:
File 1: Would you remove your shoes?
File 2: Enjoy your flight.

Line 1158:
File 1: Remove your stinger.
File 2: Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.

Line 1159:
File 1: It's part of me.
File 2: Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!

Line 1160:
File 1: I know. Just having some fun.
File 2: I think this is gonna work.

Line 1161:
File 1: Enjoy your flight.
File 2: It's got to work.

Line 1162:
File 1: Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.
File 2: Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.

Line 1163:
File 1: Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!
File 2: Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.

Line 1164:
File 1: I think this is gonna work.
File 2: I gotta get up there and talk to them.

Line 1165:
File 1: It's got to work.
File 2: Be careful.

Line 1166:
File 1: Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.
File 2: Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

Line 1167:
File 1: Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.
File 2: Captain, I'm in a real situation.

Line 1168:
File 1: I gotta get up there and talk to them.
File 2: What'd you say, Hal?

Line 1169:
File 1: Be careful.
File 2: Nothing.

Line 1170:
File 1: Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
File 2: Bee!

Line 1171:
File 1: Captain, I'm in a real situation.
File 2: Don't freak out! My entire species...

Line 1172:
File 1: What'd you say, Hal?
File 2: What are you doing?

Line 1173:
File 1: Nothing.
File 2: Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!

Line 1174:
File 1: Bee!
File 2: Who's an attorney?

Line 1175:
File 1: Don't freak out! My entire species...
File 2: Don't move.

Line 1176:
File 1: What are you doing?
File 2: Oh, Barry.

Line 1177:
File 1: Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
File 2: Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!

Line 1178:
File 1: Who's an attorney?
File 2: What happened here?

Line 1179:
File 1: Don't move.
File 2: There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.

Line 1180:
File 1: Oh, Barry.
File 2: One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!

Line 1181:
File 1: Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!
File 2: Is that another bee joke?

Line 1182:
File 1: What happened here?
File 2: No!

Line 1183:
File 1: There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.
File 2: No one's flying the plane!

Line 1184:
File 1: One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!
File 2: This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?

Line 1185:
File 1: Is that another bee joke?
File 2: This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.

Line 1186:
File 1: No!
File 2: Where's the pilot?

Line 1187:
File 1: No one's flying the plane!
File 2: He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

Line 1188:
File 1: This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?
File 2: Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?

Line 1189:
File 1: This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.
File 2: As a matter of fact, there is.

Line 1190:
File 1: Where's the pilot?
File 2: Who's that?

Line 1191:
File 1: He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.
File 2: Barry Benson.

Line 1192:
File 1: Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?
File 2: From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

Line 1193:
File 1: As a matter of fact, there is.
File 2: Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.

Line 1194:
File 1: Who's that?
File 2: It's got giant wings, huge engines.

Line 1195:
File 1: Barry Benson.
File 2: I can't fly a plane.

Line 1196:
File 1: From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
File 2: Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?

Line 1197:
File 1: Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.
File 2: Yes.

Line 1198:
File 1: It's got giant wings, huge engines.
File 2: How hard could it be?

Line 1199:
File 1: I can't fly a plane.
File 2: Wait, Barry!

Line 1200:
File 1: Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
File 2: We're headed into some lightning.

Line 1201:
File 1: Yes.
File 2: This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.

Line 1202:
File 1: How hard could it be?
File 2: Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...

Line 1203:
File 1: Wait, Barry!
File 2: That's Barry!

Line 1204:
File 1: We're headed into some lightning.
File 2: ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.

Line 1205:
File 1: This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.
File 2: Flowers?!

Line 1206:
File 1: Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...
File 2: We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.

Line 1207:
File 1: That's Barry!
File 2: Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.

Line 1208:
File 1: ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.
File 2: I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.

Line 1209:
File 1: Flowers?!
File 2: They've done enough damage.

Line 1210:
File 1: We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.
File 2: But isn't he your only hope?

Line 1211:
File 1: Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.
File 2: Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.

Line 1212:
File 1: I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.
File 2: Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?

Line 1213:
File 1: They've done enough damage.
File 2: "The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."

Line 1214:
File 1: But isn't he your only hope?
File 2: Get this on the air!

Line 1215:
File 1: Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.
File 2: Got it.

Line 1216:
File 1: Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?
File 2: Stand by.

Line 1217:
File 1: "The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."
File 2: We're going live.

Line 1218:
File 1: Get this on the air!
File 2: The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.

Line 1219:
File 1: Got it.
File 2: But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.

Line 1220:
File 1: Stand by.
File 2: More than we realized. To us, to everyone.

Line 1221:
File 1: We're going live.
File 2: That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.

Line 1222:
File 1: The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
File 2: We get behind a fellow.

Line 1223:
File 1: But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.
File 2: Black and yellow!

Line 1224:
File 1: More than we realized. To us, to everyone.
File 2: Hello!

Line 1225:
File 1: That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.
File 2: Left, right, down, hover.

Line 1226:
File 1: We get behind a fellow.
File 2: Hover?

Line 1227:
File 1: Black and yellow!
File 2: Forget hover.

Line 1228:
File 1: Hello!
File 2: This isn't so hard.

Line 1229:
File 1: Left, right, down, hover.
File 2: Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

Line 1230:
File 1: Hover?
File 2: Barry, what happened?!

Line 1231:
File 1: Forget hover.
File 2: Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.

Line 1232:
File 1: This isn't so hard.
File 2: That may have been helping me.

Line 1233:
File 1: Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
File 2: And now we're not!

Line 1234:
File 1: Barry, what happened?!
File 2: So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

Line 1235:
File 1: Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
File 2: All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!

Line 1236:
File 1: That may have been helping me.
File 2: Move out!

Line 1237:
File 1: And now we're not!
File 2: Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!

Line 1238:
File 1: So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
File 2: Don't have to yell.

Line 1239:
File 1: All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!
File 2: I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.

Line 1240:
File 1: Move out!
File 2: It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!

Line 1241:
File 1: Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!
File 2: It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

Line 1242:
File 1: Don't have to yell.
File 2: I can't do this!

Line 1243:
File 1: I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.
File 2: Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!

Line 1244:
File 1: It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
File 2: You snap out of it.

Line 1245:
File 1: It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
File 2: You snap out of it.

Line 1246:
File 1: I can't do this!
File 2: You snap out of it!

Line 1247:
File 1: Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!
File 2: You snap out of it!

Line 1248:
File 1: You snap out of it.
File 2: You snap out of it!

Line 1249:
File 1: You snap out of it.
File 2: You snap out of it!

Line 1252:
File 1: You snap out of it!
File 2: Hold it!

Line 1253:
File 1: You snap out of it!
File 2: Why? Come on, it's my turn.

Line 1254:
File 1: You snap out of it!
File 2: How is the plane flying?

Line 1255:
File 1: You snap out of it!
File 2: I don't know.

Line 1256:
File 1: Hold it!
File 2: Hello?

Line 1257:
File 1: Why? Come on, it's my turn.
File 2: Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?

Line 1258:
File 1: How is the plane flying?
File 2: The Pollen Jocks!

Line 1259:
File 1: I don't know.
File 2: They do get behind a fellow.

Line 1260:
File 1: Hello?
File 2: Black and yellow.

Line 1261:
File 1: Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?
File 2: Hello.

Line 1262:
File 1: The Pollen Jocks!
